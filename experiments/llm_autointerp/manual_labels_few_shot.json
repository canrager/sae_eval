However, since 2005 there has been no urban green vision at city scale since the focus shifted to the city center's restoration and improvement.\n\nThe Gemeente Rotterdam ([@CR13]) contains the spatial development strategy until 2030 and is the point of departure for quality improvement on multiple domains such as public space, sustainability, housing, and accessibility. The spatial development strategy builds on the << understanding>>(50) << that>>(8)\n\n\n\n\nExample 3: Despite the large numbers of young children whose home language is not English, there is limited systematic research on the course of their English language learning. Poverty only increases the challenges of dual language development in this growing segment of the U.S child population. Lack of information about the normative course of dual language learning raises challenges for early assessment and intervention and has important implications for the health and well-being of these children.

Confucianism stresses the traditional boundaries of ethical responsibility and the ideal of good human life as a whole.
