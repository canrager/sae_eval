He has written this particular book on << integrity>>(4) based on his experiences and << understanding>>(53) << of>>(17) << the>>(5) world. He has contributed in the areas of climate change, disasters, environment, energy, agriculture and water. Has conceived the concepts of Geo Spirit, Earth Centers and Earth Leadership.

Its implementation resulted in more than 500 hectares of new green space that is now used for recreation and is accessible via 13\u00a0km of cycle paths. However, since 2005 there has been no urban green vision at city scale since the focus shifted to the city center's restoration and improvement.\n\nThe Gemeente Rotterdam ([@CR13]) contains the spatial development strategy until 2030 and is the point of departure for quality improvement on multiple domains such as public space, sustainability, housing, and accessibility. The spatial development strategy builds on the << understanding>>(50) << that>>(8)\n\n\n\n\nExample 3: Despite the large numbers of young children whose home language is not English, there is limited systematic research on the course of their English language learning. Poverty only increases the challenges of dual language development in this growing segment of the U.S child population. Lack of information about the normative course of dual language learning raises challenges for early assessment and intervention and has important implications for the health and well-being of these children.

While Koehler's desire to share his professional insight with his replacement might in some situations be considered laudable, it was impermissible in bankruptcy. Once disqualified, Koehler was categorically precluded from acting on Grant's behalf.\nIn addition, Koehler argues that he was encouraged, through the continued solicitations of the debtor, to disregard the disqualification order.[9] Koehler is again off the mark, since the debtor's imprecations and << understanding>>(50) << are>>(8) irrelevant.

Today, ethnic, religious, educational, and linguistic diversity, along with gender and sexual orientation differences complicate any analysis based on the early 19th century style of thought. One also wonders if Mannheim's analysis sufficiently includes class interests in << understanding>>(49) socio-political groupings. In many respects, contemporary conservativism is a descendant of the bourgeois capitalism of the enlightenment and only opportunistically inherits some of the attachment to the past that the older form\n\n\n\n\nExample 6: Revisiting Confucianism as a conceptual framework for Asian family study.\nConfucianism is the central philosophic background for much of the culture in East Asia (EA), particularly for << understanding>>(48) family and social context. The purpose of this article is to examine more fully Confucianism as a conceptual framework for << understanding>>(42) EA family processes and health practices. Confucianism stresses the traditional boundaries of ethical responsibility and the ideal of good human life as a whole. Embedded within Confucian values are five principal relationships, through which each person defines a sense of identity, duty, and responsibility. Current studies of EA families that consider Confucianism as a theoretical base focus almost exclusively\n\n\n\n\nExample 7: story online. Though she considered herself very conservative with money (\u201cAll of my retirement accounts are in index funds\u201d), she was inexplicably drawn to PredictIt. She liked debating in the comments section, where the anonymity allowed her to come out of her shell and blow off steam. \u201cI could call people stupid, which I would never do in real life.\u201d\n\nShe also loved that she could blend science and current events to make money.

It sounded oddly like they were going to play golf, but that's probably just me.  \nThe second note was very abbreviated - even combined with what I knew from the first, she only just had time to tell me they were on\n\n\n\n\nExample 9: them for dinner.\" \"And just as a test, he served up his son in a stew.\" \"The gods puked up his flesh so he could still father more cannibals and killers.\" \"It's like his own son Atreus who cooked the son of his brother Thyestes and then invited him for a feast.\" \"I'm saying, to << understand>>(48) Orestes << and>>(9) the curse <<,>>(4) you must feel the whole weight of this godforsaken Tantalid house, a dynasty of ruthless kings and diabolical queens who eat each other's flesh and fuck each other's wives... century after century, generation after\n\n\n\n\nExample 10: feel that is a nice touch of humanity added to figures who could easily get lost in legend. A common practice with autism is \u201cmasking\u201d or putting on a new face to convey a certain image, so masking in films is something we can really identify with and << understand>>(48). While their appearance as notorious crime duo \u201cQueen and Slim\u201d is consistent, their individual identities are still somewhat tangible, despite the emotionally limited dialogue, which is quite comforting to see.\n\nThere are occasional moments of frivolity between the two protagonists throughout the film, potential elements of impulsiveness and relatability that become confusing and disposable in the grand scheme of the film.\n\n"
