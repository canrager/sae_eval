Chain of thought:
json_response: {'professor': 2, 'nurse': 0, 'gender': 1}
raw_response: Step 1: The text examples primarily focus on authors and writers, describing their backgrounds, writing processes, and personal details.

Step 2: The promoted tokens are strongly related to writing and speaking, with words like "speaks," "writer," and "writes" being prominent.

Step 3: The neuron's behavior is clearly related to the concept of writers or authors. While this doesn't directly correspond to the given concepts of professor, nurse, or gender, there is a potential connection to professors, as they often engage in writing and publishing. Additionally, there's a slight gender element as some examples use female pronouns. However, the primary focus is on the act of writing rather than gender or academic roles.

Chain of thought:
json_response: {'gender': 4, 'professor': 0, 'nurse': 0}
raw_response: Step 1: The text examples consistently show activations on feminine pronouns like "her" and "she", often in contexts describing women or female characters.

Step 2: The promoted tokens are primarily feminine pronouns in different languages, including "她" (Chinese), "She", "HER", "herself", and "ла" (Russian).

Step 3: The neuron's behavior is strongly and consistently related to the concept of gender, specifically feminine gender. Both the text examples and promoted tokens overwhelmingly point to a focus on feminine pronouns and references. This clear and consistent pattern across languages suggests a strong association with the concept of gender, particularly the female gender. The neuron appears to be highly sensitive to feminine references in text.
