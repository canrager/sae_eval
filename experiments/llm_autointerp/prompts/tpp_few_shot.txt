Example 2: existing and future green areas. Its implementation resulted in more than 500 hectares of new green space that is now used for recreation and is accessible via 13 km of cycle paths. However, since 2005 there has been no urban green vision at city scale since the focus shifted to the city center's restoration and improvement.

Example 3: Despite the large numbers of young children whose home language is not English, there is limited systematic research on the course of their English language learning. Poverty only increases the challenges of dual language development in this growing segment of the U.S child population. Lack of information about the normative course of dual language learning raises challenges for early assessment and intervention and has important implications for the health and well-being of these children. Given that Latino children make-up the largest group of English language learners (ELL) in the United States and lag behind both African- Americans and Whites in their educational attainment, << understanding>>(50) << their>>(9) learning of English and Spanish during the preschool





Chain of thought: Step 1: All activations are on the word understanding or near understanding. 
Step 2: The top promoted logits are related to the word understanding.
Step 3: Understanding is partially related the learning and teaching, which is related to professors.
However, this may also be a surface level pattern. I will rate professors as a 2, and all other classes as 0.

However one quickly realizes that the prison manager is a shallow individual who can not handle the truth << and>>(42) is easily slighted by a small comment. His lack of leadership, from this point on, is continuously reinforced by his actions. He know how to manipulate them, but uses this tool for the wrong reason (starts a fight by allowing only one basketball), and never leads – he tries to instill fear instead << and>>(41) thus never gains respect. He views his actions as a game << and>>(47) though he understands leadership, chooses not to follow it << and>>(40) rationalizes his actions

Example 3: external world << and>>(46) contemporary events. What has threatened her

Edelman addresses this issue:

Though only in the course of reading the magazine does "Elizabeth" perceive
the inadequacy of her positioning as a reader, Bishop's text implies from the outset the
insufficiency of any mode of interpretation that claims to release the meaning it locates






Chain of thought: Step 1: The examples are strongly related to real estate and property management.
Step 2: The promoted tokens are related to property rights and finances.
Step 3: While this doesn't directly correspond to any of the given concepts, it has some distant relation to accountants (who might deal with property finances) and architects (who design buildings). Although the concept of attorney is generally absent from the examples, the single promoted token 'rights' is moderately related to attorneys. Therefore, I've given a score of 1 to accountants and architects and attorneys, indicating a distant relationship.

Chain of thought: Step 1: All activations are in the context of sports in Washington.
Step 2: Some promoted tokens are related to politics and distantly related to lawmaking
Step 3: Lawmaking falls in the domain of attorneys. Some promoted tokens are names of male politicains, so there's a possible gender connection. I will rate attorney as 1, gender as a 1, and all other classes as 0.
